
  Actually this is just like the book santa but instead of books the user can adopt or donate pets instead of books

-> This app is based on the book santa app but it is for adopting the animals as pets.. Like,In the book donate screen
the active requests are shown,But in this app,Instead of books there will be names of the pets which are available to 
adopt. And instead of the book request screen there will be a screen where you can upload the photo of any pet/animal
and any description about the animal can be written like what what vaccines need to be given or anything like that
in place of the reason to request. 
-> And the user can change his profile settings like the book santa and upload profile pic..
 
 Most of it is like the book santa so we can use the same code and it will be completed quickly...
